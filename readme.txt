Did these on the school computers as per usual.


Everything up untill shading works as you know my problem with triangles. I'm convinced that whatever is causing the problems with shading for triangles is also getting in the way of shadows working as I think I implemented shadows correctly. Don't get me started on reflections.

Anyways, for part 5 I made a delightful pyrimad of spheres with a cool trapezoidal floor made from triangles and a splendid purple plane as a backdrop. In case thats not enough and because I messed up on the other requirments I created a scaling factor in an attempt to make the pyramid look like a molecule (akin to those youd see in organic chemistry modelling) as a cool extra. 

I also added in a bonus scene "Der Wahnsinn von Lee" (translated: the madness of lee). I must say this scene alone evokes such an emotional response that it would be hard not to overlook my other mistakes in this assignment. In fact, I challenge you to stare at it for a good 5 seconds without beggining to contemplate your own existence.
